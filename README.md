# Linux Admin Labs (LPIC-1) | Mohammad Fathi

This repository documents my hands-on Linux administration practice while studying LPIC-1.

The goal is to build practical Linux skills for Web Operations, Cloud Support, and DevOps-oriented roles.

## Lab Environment

I am using Linux virtual machines to practice LPIC-1 topics in a safe lab environment.

Distributions used:

- Ubuntu
- Fedora
- Kali

The purpose of using multiple distributions is to become familiar with both Debian-based and Red Hat-based Linux environments.

---


## Purpose

This project is part of my transition into:

- Web Operations
- Cloud Engineering
- DevOps roles

## Background

I have 15+ years of experience as a web platform founder and technical project manager, with a background in web development, SEO, digital platforms, and SaaS product management.

I am currently strengthening my Linux, Docker, Terraform, and cloud infrastructure skills for relocation opportunities.
